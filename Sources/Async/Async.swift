/**
 Execute a closure asynchronously on a default asynchronous queue, if the number of currently scheduled
 tasks do not exceed a limit based on the number of available cores, otherwise the task is run synchronously.
 
 If `excecutionBlock` throws, the returned `Future`'s `value` property will be `nil`, and its
 `error` property will contain the thrown `error`.
 
 Using this method has two advantages:
 
    - It returns a `Future` making asynchronous tasks easiser
    - It prevents flooding Grand Central Dispatch with asynchronous which can degrade its performance.
 
 - Note: This `Async` module provides an exenstion on `DispatchQueue` containing an instance
 method that allows you to execute a closure on a `DispatchQueue` you specify without regard to the
 number of cores on the system.  That method allows you to take advantage of returning a `Future` while
 by-passing the CPU limit imposed by this function, and of course, you can use it on any `DispatchQueue`
 you wish, where as this one is a convenience that runs on a privately defined queue
 
 - Parameters:
    - delay: Number of seconds to delay executing `executionBlock`, or `nil` for no delay.
    - executionBlock: The closure to be executed
 
 - Returns: a `Future` containing either the value returned by the closure, or an `Error` thrown by it.
